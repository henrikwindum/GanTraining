# StyleSwin: Transformer-Based GAN for High-Resolution Image Generation on Low-Resolution Images

Welcome to the official repository of our project, where we explore the groundbreaking capabilities of StyleSwin, a Transformer-Based GAN designed for High-Resolution Image Generation, and its application to Low-Resolution Image Generation. Originally developed by Bowen Zhang et al., StyleSwin has set a new benchmark in image synthesis with its exceptional ability to generate detailed and realistic high-resolution images. In this project, we aim to test and extend the efficacy of StyleSwin to low-resolution image generation tasks.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate how well StyleSwin, a model renowned for its performance in high-resolution image generation, adapts to the challenge of generating high-quality images from low-resolution inputs. By leveraging the transformer-based architecture of StyleSwin, we hypothesize that the model can capture intricate details and textures even when working with less information, thereby producing superior low-resolution image outputs compared to traditional methods.

## Datasets

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we will experiment with a variety of datasets, each offering unique challenges and characteristics:

- **MNIST**: A classic dataset of handwritten digits that serves as a baseline for image generation tasks.
- **CIFAR10**: Consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, offering a more diverse and challenging scenario for low-resolution image generation.
- **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**: A dataset with a varied set of pet images, providing a real-world challenge due to its complexity and the fine details in the textures of animal fur.
- **Subsets of the Above Datasets**: To further our understanding, we will also explore subsets of these datasets, focusing on specific classes or characteristics to assess the model's performance in more controlled scenarios.

## Experimental Focus: Model Granularity

A pivotal aspect of our project is investigating the impact of model granularity on the quality of synthetic images generated by StyleSwin. Lowering the granularity, or the level of detail at which the model operates, in both the generator and discriminator components of the GAN, could potentially lead to significant improvements in image quality, especially in low-resolution settings.

The intuition behind this focus is that by adjusting the granularity, we can fine-tune the model's sensitivity to details, which is crucial when working with low-resolution images. High granularity might lead the model to overlook essential features in low-resolution inputs, while too low granularity could cause the model to generate overly smooth or unrealistic images. Finding the right balance could enhance the model's ability to produce detailed, realistic images even when starting from low-resolution inputs.

### Objectives:

- **Assess the Impact of Granularity**: To systematically evaluate how variations in model granularity affect the fidelity and realism of generated images, particularly for low-resolution inputs.
- **Optimize Model Performance**: To identify optimal settings for granularity that maximize image quality, thereby extending the applicability of StyleSwin to a broader range of image generation tasks.
- **Innovation in Low-Resolution Image Generation**: To contribute new insights and methodologies for enhancing low-resolution image generation, setting new standards for quality and efficiency in the field.

This exploration into model granularity stands to not only advance our understanding of Transformer-Based GANs but also to pioneer new approaches to low-resolution image generation that could benefit various applications, from digital art to enhancing visual data in scientific research.
