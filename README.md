# StyleSwin: Transformer-Based GAN for High-Resolution Image Generation on Low-Resolution Images

Welcome to the official repository of our project, where we explore the groundbreaking capabilities of StyleSwin, a Transformer-Based GAN designed for High-Resolution Image Generation, and its application to Low-Resolution Image Generation. Originally developed by Bowen Zhang et al., StyleSwin has set a new benchmark in image synthesis with its exceptional ability to generate detailed and realistic high-resolution images. In this project, we aim to test and extend the efficacy of StyleSwin to low-resolution image generation tasks.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate how well StyleSwin, a model renowned for its performance in high-resolution image generation, adapts to the challenge of generating high-quality images from low-resolution inputs. By leveraging the transformer-based architecture of StyleSwin, we hypothesize that the model can capture intricate details and textures even when working with less information, thereby producing superior low-resolution image outputs compared to traditional methods.

## Datasets

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we will experiment with a variety of datasets, each offering unique challenges and characteristics:

- **MNIST**: A classic dataset of handwritten digits that serves as a baseline for image generation tasks.
- **CIFAR10**: Consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, offering a more diverse and challenging scenario for low-resolution image generation.
- **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**: A dataset with a varied set of pet images, providing a real-world challenge due to its complexity and the fine details in the textures of animal fur.
- **Subsets of the Above Datasets**: To further our understanding, we will also explore subsets of these datasets, focusing on specific classes or characteristics to assess the model's performance in more controlled scenarios.

## Acknowledgments

All credits for the development of the StyleSwin model go to the remarkable work of Bowen Zhang et al. Their contributions to the field of image generation have opened new pathways for research and application, enabling projects like ours to explore new frontiers in low-resolution image synthesis.

Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting journey to push the boundaries of what's possible with Transformer-Based GANs in the realm of low-resolution image generation.
